## Building Modern Web Applications

Modern web development requires a thoughtful approach to architecture, performance, and user experience. Let's explore the key principles.

### Component-Based Architecture

Break your application into reusable components. This promotes code reusability and makes maintenance easier.

### Performance Optimization

Consider lazy loading, code splitting, and optimizing assets. Modern tools like Vite and Webpack can help with this.

### Responsive Design

Ensure your application works seamlessly across all device sizes. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts.

### Accessibility

Make your application accessible to all users. Use semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, and ensure keyboard navigation works.

By following these principles, you'll create applications that are both powerful and user-friendly.
