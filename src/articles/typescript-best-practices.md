## TypeScript Best Practices

TypeScript brings type safety to JavaScript, making your code more maintainable and less error-prone. Here are some best practices to follow.

### Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json. This ensures maximum type safety and catches potential errors early.

### Define Clear Interfaces

Create well-defined interfaces for your data structures. This makes your code self-documenting and easier to understand.

### Avoid Using 'any'

While TypeScript allows the 'any' type, try to avoid it. Use proper types or 'unknown' when the type is truly unknown.

Following these practices will help you write more robust and maintainable TypeScript code.
